This is the test branch of reconstructing the site using Django as backend and Vue.js as frontend framework.

***Auto generated documentation is coming. For now, just use these hand written documentations***

Setup:

Backend-Django:
  -Python 3
    1.Check python version on your computer by typing: "python3 --version" in terminal, chances are you might have already have it in your computer.
    2. If not, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download a python3 version(latest stable version recommended).
    
  -PIP
    1. After downloading python, type in "pip --version" to check if python is already installed, it shall come along with the python downloads.
  -venv
    1. Try using "pip install virtualenv" command in terminal after pip is installed.
    
To run the backend, make sure to cd into the Django-Vue folder, and then run "python manage.py runserver", the backend should be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ through your browser.
    
Frontend-Vue.js:
  -Node.js
    1. Make sure to download Node.js 6.x or newer and NPM version 3 or newer through this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. The LTS version shall be good.
    2. After downloaded and installed globally, in your Django-Vue folder, you could just run "npm install" from the terminal to install all the other dependencies instead of doing it manually.
    
To run the frontend, make sure to cd into the frontend folder within the Django-Vue folder, and then run "npm run dev", the frontend should be running on http://localhost:8080 through your browser.

Thanks and the more detailed auto generated documentation shall be coming up soon! :)
